Master's thesis project comparing machine learning algorithms (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, OLS) to predict Time on Market (TOM) for Dutch residential properties using RFECV-based feature selection.
# Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Time on Market (TOM)

This repository contains the code, models, and thesis related to my Master's research at Tilburg University. The study evaluates how well machine learning algorithms predict **Time on Market (TOM)** for residential properties in the Netherlands.

## 📄 Thesis Overview

The project compares several models:
- ✅ Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) — baseline
- ✅ Random Forest
- ✅ XGBoost
- ✅ CatBoost (best performer)
- ✅ LightGBM

It also uses:
- 🧠 **RFECV (Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation)** for feature selection
- 📊 Real estate dataset from the **Funda-Sold** platform (2020–2023)

📄 The full thesis is available in `thesis.pdf`.
